            <p class="info-about">
                Rolex SA is a British-founded Swiss watch designer and manufacturer based in Geneva, Switzerland. <br>Founded in 1905 as Wilsdorf and Davis by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, England, the company registered the word Rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908, and it became Rolex Watch Co. Ltd. in 1915.<br> After World War I, the company moved its base of operations to Geneva because of the unfavorable economy in the United Kingdom. In 1920, Hans Wilsdorf registered Montres Rolex SA in Geneva as the new company name; it later became Rolex SA. Since 1960, the company has been owned by the Hans Wilsdorf Foundation, a private family trust.

                <br>Rolex SA and its subsidiary Montres Tudor SA design, make, distribute, and service wristwatches sold under the Rolex and Tudor brands.

                Originally founded in 1905 in London by a 24-year-old Hans Wilsdorf and brother-in-law Alfred Davis, Rolex was first known as Wilsdorf and Davis. They originally imported movements, housed them in British cases, and sold them to jewelers. Through this, the pair saw the potential for developing their own brand. In 1908 this was realized when Wilsdorf secured the name Rolex.
                <br>
                The history of Rolex is tied to the history of watchmaking in the 1900s. Rolex boasts of having over 500 different patents since its inception. This comes as no surprise as there are over 2,000 employees in just the manufacturing and assembly of movements. The company also has several research and development departments looking at everything from new watches, efficient manufacturing and metals, to testing.

                From the start of the brand, Hans Wilsdorf always pushed the envelope with innovation. This didnâ€™t stop with the Oyster swim across the channel, instead, that was just the beginning. Rolex has been involved in some of the biggest explorations, sports and entertainment events.
